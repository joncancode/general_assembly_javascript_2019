            </section>
            <section>
              <p>Remember early in the class when we were first introduced to Node?</p>
            <pre><code>
      setTimeout( function(){
        console.log("This runs second");
      }, 1000 );

      console.log("This runs first");
            </code></pre>
            <li>Let's run this example again</li>
            <li>Asynchronous program is basically 'now and later' programming</li>
            </section>
            <section>

            </section>
            <section>
              <li>We have worked with numerous scenarios where we have run a block of code after a user has performed an action. Take the following scenario from our DOM and jQuery continued lesson</li>
              <pre><code>
    let $thingList = $('#fav-list');

    $thingList.on('mouseleave', 'li', function(e) {
      ...
    }); 
              </code></pre>
              <li class="fragment">Taking a close look at the jQuery <code>on()</code> method, we notice two very important overlooked concepts:</li>
            <ol class="fragment">
              <li>The <code>on()</code> method is taking a function as one of its parameters</li>
              <li>The function we are passing into the <code>on()</code> method does not have a name, we are just passing a raw function: the function keyword, a parameter list, and a function body inside curly braces</li>
            </ol>

              <h2 class="title">Functions as First-Class Objects</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
              <li>By "first-class objects", we just mean that they can be used in any part of the code that strings, arrays, or data of any other type can be used</li>
              <li class="fragment">This means we can store functions as variables, pass them as arguments to other functions, return them from other functions, or just run them ad-hoc without the need to assign them to anything</li>
              <li class="fragment"> A function that takes another function as an argument, or returns a function, is called a higher-order function</li>
              <li class="fragment">Functions being passed as parameters:</li>
              <pre class="fragment"><code>
              setTimeout( function(){
                console.log("Hello world");
              }, 1000 );
            </code></pre>
            <li class="fragment">In this scenario setTimeout is taking a function as its first parameter, and the time (in milliseconds) to wait before running that function, as its second parameter</li>
            </section>

            <section>

              <pre><code>
      var blastOff = function() {
        console.log("Blasting off!");
      }
    
      function launchRocket(rocketName, blastOffCallback) {
        console.log("Launching " + rocketName);
        console.log("3... 2... 1...");
        blastOffCallback();
      }
    
      launchRocket("Viking", blastOff);
    
      // => Launching Viking
      // => 3... 2... 1...
      // => Blasting off!
              </code></pre>

            <li>In the above example, the function being passed into <code>launchRocket</code> is acting as a "callback", which basically means a function that is designed to be executed by the code of another function</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, we can also pass functions as arguments to other functions, and to return functions from other functions</li>
            <li>We'll cover <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures" target="_blank">Closures</a> in a few classes</li>

                <li>Write a function, <code>makeCountingFunction()</code>, that returns another function. The function returned by <code>makeCountingFunction()</code> should take an array as an argument, and return the number of odd integers in the array</li>
                <li><code>makeCountingFunction()</code> itself should take as its only argument something called a "predicate function", a function designed to run a test on each item in an array</li>
                <li>Test your code by running it in the command line using node</li>

          </section>
          <section>
              <li>Remember this:</li>
              <pre><code>
              setTimeout( function(){
                console.log("Hello world");
              }, 1000 );
            </code></pre>
            <li class="fragment">The function being passed into setTimeout() above is called an anonymous function expression because it is not named in any way -- it is not a function expression that got assigned to a variable name, and neither is it a function that got its name in a function declaration</li>
          </section>

        <section>
          <li>Note that you don't have to pass anonymous functions as callbacks in cases like this -- you can pass named functions as well, no matter how they got their names</li>
          <pre><code>
    function sayHi() {
      console.log("Hello world");
    }
  
    var sayBye = function() {
      console.log("Goodbye world");
    }
  
    setTimeout(sayHi, 1000 );
    setTimeout(sayBye, 1261440000000);
  
    // (1,261,440,000,000 milliseconds is 40 years)
            </code></pre>
        <li>Just remember: Anonymous functions are great, but they may give you some trouble when debugging, if you're looking at a stack trace and it shows a big column of unnamed functions</li>
        </section>

    <section>
      <p>Immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFEs - "iffy's")</p>
    <li class="fragment">We have the ability to execute our function expressions as soon as they are declared. Notice the () at the end of the following:</li>
    <pre class="fragment"><code>
  let countDown = function() {
    let counter;
    for(counter = 3; counter > 0; counter--) {
      console.log(counter);
    }
  }();
                </code></pre>
  </section>
<section>
<li>A bit less common, but we can also pass arguments into them</li>
    <pre><code>
  let counterStartPoint = 3;

  (function countDown( global ){
    let counter;
    for(counter = global.counterStartPoint; counter > 0; counter--) {
      console.log(counter)
    }

  })( window );

  console.log( counterStartPoint ); // 3
                      </code></pre>

              <li>Callbacks and closures are the bread and butter of asynchronous programming</li>
              <li class="fragment">Looking back at our DOM and APIs lessons, our interfaces update on user interactions and/or once we receive data from remote locations. Best practices in JS call for these reactions to be handled in the form of callbacks</li>
              <li class="fragment">Callbacks, closures, and IIFEs allow us to better organize our code for each scenario, as well as make our functions significantly more dynamic</li>
